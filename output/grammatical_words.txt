Below are the suffixes that were considered ungrammatical by LAML upon my first run of the program on a dataset of grammatical (attested) words of russian. These suffixes attracted my attention because there was supposed to be no
such suffixes in this dataset and their presence can illustrate some weaknesses of either our algorithm or bugs in the code itself.

_ ʃ vʲ =  we were missing a character at the beginning of a word, and the program thot this was a suffix. Adding the missing character fixed the problem.
j ó _ = This one is an interesting case: according to our feature library, 'j' is considered a vowel (this is up for discussion what we should consider it). Our program correctly assumed that ó only occured after consonants, so it flagged this input as ungrammatical. I have changed the value of 'j' to be a consonant, this, however, did not resolve the problem, because according to our feature library, 'j' is (correctly) considered unrounded, whereas the enviro of ó stipulates that a segment needs to be rounded. Upon further inspection I also found that a whole host of other features will prevent this word from being considered grammatical, most of them having to do with 'j' being considered a vowel.
\xca\xa7\xca\xb2 e k = A yer word creeped in to our dataset.
g o lʲ = ugol', yet another pesky yer :)
